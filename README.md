# HackPack
This is SIGAI's HackPack repository.

We keep resources on all things A.I. here that've been vetted by UCF's A.I. researchers and enthusiasts. 

It has resources ranging from the very beginnings to the frontier of the field.

## Nonfiction Novels All Should Read
> What separates a good researcher from a great researcher is intuition. Building that is hard but a good place to start is with books that ask good questions, talk about high-level concepts, and leave the technical details to the textbooks.
