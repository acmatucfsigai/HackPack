# HackPack
This is SIGAI's HackPack repository.

We keep resources on all things A.I. here that've been vetted by UCF's A.I. researchers and enthusiasts. 

It has resources ranging from the very beginnings to the frontier of the field.



## Great Papers You Should Checkout
> (A) == Advanced (N) == Novice (B) == Beginner (S) == Short (L) == Long

*Building Machines That Learn and Think Like People* -- (A, L) Lake, et. al

## Nonfiction Novels All Should Read
> What separates a good researcher from a great researcher is intuition. To build that, it's best to read books that ask good questions, talk about high-level concepts, and leave the technical details to the textbooks.

*Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid* -- Douglas Hofstadter 

*Mind Design II* -- edited by John Haugeland

*The Master Algorithm* -- Pedro Domingos

*The Society of Mind* -- Marvin Minsky
